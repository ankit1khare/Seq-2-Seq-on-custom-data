# TimeIT

A cross-platform app to set time intervals for alarm using voice input. Will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to paraphrase and set duration/number of intervals. Suitable for assistance during exercise, yoga, taking medications etc.

Currently I am playing with sequence to sequence and observing interesting things that I can do to train a neural network that can indentify intervals and interval durations within the different varieties of text phrases provided to it as input.
